        <h2 id="you-dont-read-terms-and-conditions-of-services-you-use">You dont read Terms and Conditions of services you use</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face the reality, you can&rsquo;t read 20 min of Terms and Conditions in 2 seconds every website or services you visit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you actually, once in your life, seriously read one with all the attention it deserves to fully understand at which extent your privacy is at stake? I did it couple of times before I realized how vain effort it was. Every single words and statements are carefully crafted to enable business to use your data in every manner possible and avoid any liability. Terms and conditions are changing multiple times a week or even a day for some big techs, and most of those terms being online, you may not be able to remember which version of those terms you once have accepted without investigating the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">wayback machine</a>.</p>
<p>It is a real chance that terms and conditions does not substitute to law and may be considered abusive in Court in some circumstances. To illustrate, F-Secure made this little <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/14/wifi-terms-and-conditions-thousands-sign-up-clean-sewage-did-not-read-small-print">social experiment</a> where people where unwillingly accepting the unacceptable simply because they did not read the small prints to obtain free WiFi: the &ldquo;Herod clause&rdquo; was requiring them to give away their first born child, or they found themselves legally bounded to thousands of hour of community services to clean sewage.</p>
<h2 id="theyll-wait-until-you-give-up-and-approve-what-you-disagree">They&rsquo;ll wait until you give-up and approve what you disagree</h2>
<p>At the patience game of who will give-up first into accepting or removing unfair terms and conditions, Big Techs wins. They have all the time in the world to wait for you to accept the new terms and reopen the services, while on the other hand, you may have a Business or something that relies on this service and therefore you may be loosing money unless you consent to approve those changes. Regardless whether those changes are fair or not, you can still challenge in court but it is costly and most jurisdiction being liberal will be in favor of not intervening into companies private business and policies. They are very well aware of what people can and can&rsquo;t do and are often playing cards keeping people ignorant of some rights.</p>
<p>A good example are <code>cookies</code> when visiting websites. If you are like me, you don&rsquo;t like being tracked by them so perhaps you use some extensions to block them. However every visit of an article on some major websites will require us to approve usage of cookies as well as their terms before accessing the page, article or content which is otherwise publicly available. It is totally fine to refuse those cookies, but see:</p>
<ul>
<li>how big is the <code>I approve everything</code> button</li>
<li>where is the <code>I refuse</code> button or the <code>maybe another time, please</code> option?</li>
<li>when you can refuse you are kicked out with a message: Sorry you can&rsquo;t access the service without accepting our terms.</li>
<li>how a single click on the <code>I approve</code> button binds you with current and future terms, with a simple cookie</li>
<li>how complex for most it is too managed every single cookies</li>
</ul>
<p>This is even more obvious on mobile applications at every single Android or iOS update, you have to accept and can&rsquo;t refuse unless you want to stay exposed with unpatched critical vulnerabilities that may expose your data even more. You have to accept Instagram or Whatsapp new terms or you will progressively or immediately loose the whole or part of the service: a pop-up will harass you and show-up every time the app is being used until you finally click (often by accident) on the <code>OK</code> button. Impossible trade-off to compromise security for privacy, I&rsquo;ll loose both if I choose this path &hellip;</p>
<h2 id="should-i-approve-everything-or-refrain-from-using-it">Should I approve everything or refrain from using it</h2>
<p>You may disagree a single term or a unique condition among hundreds, well in this case, we can say that you have the right not to use this services? After all those are private business that offers you a service, sometimes without a Premium, and therefore they have the right to force your consent into approving every single of their hundreds of terms? Silly of me, we don&rsquo;t have all the same reasons and incentives (not) to use a certain service, so there is no single right answer and each of us <strong>HAVE TO</strong> abide and accept every single terms to use those services, unless we want to be a social media hermit.</p>
<p>In fact this is not a real choice, it is rather <strong>an extorsion of consent</strong> in a form of forcing you to make a compromise between what you think is deemed acceptable vs what is not acceptable, and therefore it is all about the perceived value of the service. How does <code>Acceptance</code> of the unacceptable hurts you less or more then the need or satisfaction of enjoying this service? It is commonly established that human beings are social &ldquo;animals&rdquo; and that The Needs for social interaction is among the most prominent in the <strong><a href="https://0xade1.github.io/$DEV_BASEURL/posts/2021/09/social-media-dont-care-for-your-privacy/">Maslow pyramid</a></strong>. The telephone, the internet were once limited to an elite before it got considered as <strong>first necessity</strong> services that should be guaranteed by governments; in the same manner and without falling into communism, the right to access social media services and exercise free-speech without being shutdown or erased because of the shareholder or executive ideology of the moment, should be a right guaranteed by governments and ruled by law where only a judge can decide to conceal or delete your content.</p>
<p>Youngest generation from the 2000s never had a digital privacy and lack of safety education or awareness that <a href="https://0xade1.github.io/$DEV_BASEURL/posts/2021/09/social-media-dont-care-for-your-privacy/">social media aims to make money more then they care for our wellness</a>**. The telephone, the internet were once limited to an elite before it got considered as **first necessity** services that should be guaranteed by governments; in the same manner and without falling into communism, the right to access social media services and exercise free-speech without being shutdown or erased because of the shareholder or executive ideology of the moment, should be a right guaranteed by governments and ruled by law where only a judge can decide to conceal or delete your content., they were born in a period of explosion of social media where everything has to be shared, and our teenagers are very sensitive to social code and pressure to be followed.</p>
<p>We are litterally replacing the 90s generation of privacy-minded people borned with a wild and free internet with a new generation of young people unaware of the importance of protecting and keeping control on their private information, as well as not delegating their security and privacy to companies they should protect themselves from: I perceive this generation as too easily consenting to approve everything and very prone to leak very private information that could be used by governments, private companies, or &ldquo;friends&rdquo; into coercing them to do what they will otherwise be reluctant to approve.</p>
<h2 id="a-pact-with-the-devil-you-cant-sign-out">A pact with the devil you can&rsquo;t sign-out?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your acceptance of past terms implies acceptance of any future terms?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it does not, but nonetheless <strong>so called minor changes</strong> are constant and fortunately do not require you to re-approve every single time. Overtime, the lump sum of those insignificant changes may result in something very different then the initially approved terms. How many people tracking and reviewing those changes? well, it is safe to say not legion, or at least not me, because time is too precious to be spend it in lost causes. Anyway, most of us, if not all, do not even remember when or <strong>what have we &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; on the past</strong> (assuming we ever read it); and it is only when we feel we have been screwed-up, that we start to experience that sharing our data may have consequences and that fraud exists with companies knowingly or inadvertently abusing customer rights. We may shout and engage in court, maybe following a data breach headline on the newspapers &hellip; but it is generally too late. <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Try it yourself</a> and look on how many data breach your personal details have been leaked.</p>
<p>The internet has a memory and never forget: once your data is leaked, it is available forever, either publicly or in the darkweb. Also the concept of <code>privacy</code> means different things between jurisdiction, resulting in an incredible misunderstanding of each other regulation and laws as well as many misconceptions on what is vs what is not privacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is my PII something I have or something I am?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PII stands for Private Individual Information, and depending on the history (European citizens have a long history of privacy invasions with hundreds of wars, while US history is more recent) the definition of privacy differs very clearly. In Europe, PII is something that belongs to the being with the meaning of <code>something I am</code> while in most english speaking countries that have not been occupied during world wars, it is more <code>something I have</code>. From this starting point, it is easy to understand, that I can sell the property that I have while I cannot sell what I am (an organ, an eye &hellip;, well in some countries you definitely can).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the color of my eyes an attribute that my eyes have or is it part of my identity. Can someone trade the color of my eyes, my organ, or any part or the whole of my identity or body? Can I sell my identity, or can my identity or part of it be sold or disclosed to a third party?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to evaluate the damages and the material compensation for a PII data being leaked? In the US, privacy has its moment only when it comes with cyber breach making headlines. Also the Legal system in the US can&rsquo;t easily establish that there is actually financial damages unless you are financially robust to pay a lawyer or join a class action.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-have-to-trust-third-parties">Why do I have to trust Third-parties?</h2>
<p>Remember Cambridge Analytica? No Facebook users ever heard of or knew that this third-party company was harvesting their most private data to profile users and influence election. That was lawfully possible thanks to Facebook Terms and Conditions. If I trust Facebook, does it mean I have to trust any of its third parties?</p>
<p>With some media propaganda and Public Relationship magic, all the blame was thrown-away by Facebook onto this British company and its holding who did not survive its reputation loss. While Facebook on the other hand was almost totally waived of its responsibility in the opinion. If I give my money to a bank and this bank looses my money because of its third-party committing a crime or a fraud, well I have no knowledge of this third-party, any clause waiving the bank of its responsibility can be considered abusive in court, and I am rightfully keeping the bank fully accountable to recover my assets and liable for any damages it causes. Sadly it does not work the same with Data mishandling or data breaches.</p>
