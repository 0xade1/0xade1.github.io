<h3 id="social-media-dominant-ideology-is-corrupting-people-thoughts">Social Media dominant ideology is corrupting people thoughts</h3>
<p>In an increasingly manicheist world loosing its sense of shades and scales of Tolerance towards extremes sides,
I found difficult to publicly express my view of facts and events that may contradicts dominant ideology.
I was looking for a way to post my opinions and thoughts online while avoiding the new norm of social media pressure
that systematically judges you according to some political prism or psychological bias.</p>
<p>While social network is the right place to reach the mass, it is certainly not the forum were you can speak freely and openly
without consequences, and I felt my wording will be influenced by my readers and not honestly reflects what is on my mind.
Thinking a bit further I have realized that my readers may want to comment as well,
and I was wondering how I could offer them this feature with the same level of privacy I am advocating in this post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the limit of freedom of speech when you apply self-censorship to avoid hypothetical consequences that may or may never occure,
such as loosing your job, contracts or opportunities because some folks may not like what you have to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So well I have chosen to keep my ambition small with a limited reach and without associating my name in a too obvious manner
to whoever may want to use what I have posted online against me.
I bet that those who find value in what I post will share and promote its content
or follow some of the present guidelines in this article to safeguard their own privacy,
and I trust that those who know me will respect that and avoid to disclose my identity.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-constantly-tracked-and-profiled">We are constantly tracked and profiled</h3>
<p><strong>Anonymity vs Pseudonymity vs Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Purpose in here has never been and will never be anonymity: any motivated actors or government can easily track back to my personal identity.
Pseudonymity is more appropriate to describe in which way I can reach a much better level of privacy that prevents:</p>
<ul>
<li>mass surveillance of citizen&rsquo;s opinion from governments</li>
<li>tracking, profiling and targeted ads from big techs</li>
<li>internal pressure or retorsion ignited be your company executives</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A blog that tracks my audience hurts my life principles</strong></p>
<p>I could have chosen the lazy way with a blog hosted in <strong>medium</strong> or <strong>blogpost</strong> or equivalent.
However the entire purpose of this is to raise awareness and protect my audience privacy from various tracking and fingerprinting techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>capture your cookies or navigation history</li>
<li>capture your movement from, to or within the website</li>
<li>capture your eyes: which portion of a page are you looking the most</li>
<li>map your visit activity with an external account (google)</li>
<li>harvest your details for commercial gain</li>
<li>track your identity for marketing campaigns through various techniques:
<ul>
<li>browser fingerprinting</li>
<li>device fingerprinting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deliver a personalized customer journey <strong>bullshit</strong> across devices, channels and platforms with Adbrain customer ID mapping technology</li>
<li>Behavioral fingerprinting with Machine Learning behavior pattern analysis</li>
<li>bother your audience with advertisement within your site, even when they don&rsquo;t comment</li>
<li>slow down navigation and traffic, and may even lag when showing my pages</li>
<li>use domain obfuscation and various techniques to try to evade ads blocker</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side note, 99% of the internet is embedding tracker such as google-analytics, twitter or facebook like buttons and much more,
and github may have some analytics on server logs regarding github-pages,
so I can only advocate that you use at least a VPN or some kind of browser extensions such as <strong>ublock origin</strong> or <strong>privacy badger</strong>.
But this is another blog post topic.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-built-this-privacy-friendly-blog">How I built this privacy friendly blog</h2>
<h3 id="a-private-email-address-to-register-github-pages">a private email address to register github pages</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have first created an anonymous email address for the solely purpose to register a github account without sharing my personal details or email.
Any privacy-friendly email provider such as protonvpn or tutanota will be fine, as long as they don&rsquo;t track you. I won&rsquo;t use this email or email alias for any other purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a first approach and before investing in domain name and hosting, we can host our website for free on <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a></strong>.
The website will be accessible with <code>username.github.io</code>, so it is better not to use an overly complicated or long username, short is better.
Should I mention that putting your real name as username, defeats the purpose of this article?</p>

<h3 id="a-statically-generated-website-not-to-be-hacked">A statically generated website not to be hacked</h3>
<p>What is common with all <strong>CMS (Content management system)</strong> I know such as <code>wordpress</code>, <code>drupal</code>, <code>joomla</code> &hellip;
is how frequently hackers exploits zero-days or disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise those websites.
Whether the backend is PHP, ASP.Net, Java, Nodejs, &hellip; does not matter as much as the perspective for a hacker to takeover
the website backend to remotely execute code. Another major issues are backend and software updates (operating system, CMS &hellip;)
which may not be performed timely, or may break the website between major upgrades.
I personnally don&rsquo;t want to spend time patching things of fixing things after patching.</p>
<p>To avoid the above issues, I made the decision to go for a statically generated website with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
As there is no server-side code, it is closed to impossible to takeover the backend and
a more probable attack vector is to compromise instead the github credentials, tokens or ssh keys &hellip;
which are not accessible from the website itself, but from my laptop which therefore becomes the most likely attack vector.
While, most of the security of the blog is managed by github directly, there is a set of good practices that I generally recommend,
to avoid being the weakest link:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a password manager to vault your email and github credentials, with strong password encryption</li>
<li>secure your ssh keys with a passphrase</li>
<li>use a different ssh keys per repositories</li>
<li>github token should have the minimum permissions as possible</li>
<li>never reuse an existing github token for a different purpose, create a new token instead</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-deployment-strategy-to-mitigate-your-real-identity-leak">A deployment strategy to mitigate your real identity leak</h3>
<p>Manual is always error-prone and may result in leaking my identity by mistake.
I have therefore decided to automate the build and deployment of the hugo static website into GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
Creating a Hugo website and setting up a GitHub pages is out of scope for this article.</p>
<p>There is mostly two strategies to deal with deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>use a single repository</strong> with two branches: main branch for source code and gh-pages for published website</li>
<li><strong>use separate repositories</strong>: the source code is in a private repository and receive manual commits, github-actions auto-commit static pages into the gh-pages repo</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>single repository</th>
<th>Separate repositories</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>🟢 single repository = &gt; less maintenance</td>
<td>🔴 Additional work to set up and configure two repos (one-time-effort)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 different contents between your source branch and the gh-pages branch</td>
<td>💚 Align with clean git branching strategies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 commit leaks and comments are publicly available, beware of <code>git config</code></td>
<td>💚 manual commit on a private repo, github-actions to push without leak to your gh-pages repo</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The separate repositories approach works better on a pure SecOps perspective,
but it is not sufficient as it could be possible to inadvertently leak information on the articles content itself.
Therefore I have to consider the review process prior github-actions automatically build and deploy content to gh-pages.</p>
<p>When considering the review process, we must consider as well that we can build and re-deploy :</p>
<ul>
<li>at every single commit</li>
<li>when reviewing an issue in github</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>every single commit</th>
<th>after a PR is approved</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>🔴 There is no possible review process</td>
<td>💚 you can enforce review and squash commits prior merge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 once commited, content is publicly exposed</td>
<td>💚 once committed you have to approve before merge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 all commits metadata are publicly available</td>
<td>💚 source repo commits are private, gh-pages commits have no sensitive information</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 energy consuming</td>
<td>💚 Energy friendly as we build only when we have meaningful changes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We will build and deploy after a PR (a github issue) is approved</p>
<h3 id="a-comment-engine-which-is-respectful-of-your-privacy">A comment engine which is respectful of your privacy</h3>
<p>When it comes with blogging, we want to interact with people and receive feedback. This interaction is priceless to confront ideas and build better ones.
While there is plethor of engines to offer incredibly friendly comment features on a static blog, I found the privacy price-tag incredibly high,
and most of those solutions were quite expensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again whether cheap or expensive, money trail implies easy back-tracking to people real identity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a backend, I need to use javascript tokens and a third-party engine such as infamous <code>disqus</code>, and I can&rsquo;t keep to question
the security of such tokens: it could be used by someone malicious to flood me with thousands of fake comments.
Another option could be <code>facebook comments</code> which requires user to be tracked by facebook instead of disqus.</p>
<p>Such third-parties tracking my audience and my website traffic totally goes against my principles, whichever the reason (targeted ads&hellip;).
I found instead that anybody can create an anonymous or pseudonymized github account like the gh-pages account running this website,
and this will allow them to comment or contribute to my privacy project without a need to disclose their real identity nor register an external services.</p>
<p>This website is using <code>github issues</code> as a backend and offers all commenting features available in github 😍 !!!
It is totally free and does not require a third party or a token:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each visitor can read all comments anonymously (no login required)</li>
<li>Each visitor is offered the possibility to leave a comment with their github account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>quick comparison analysis</strong>:</p>
<p>The main reason for using github for comments is because github issues have not be designed with profiling or tracking in mind
as opposed to social media. It is using API and is free from those fancy but common features aiming to track people:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TEST YOUR GITHUB ACTION with DUMMY content</strong></li>
<li><strong>VERIFY your github commits meta data are free from leaks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I had to go on a long process of tries, fails and learn: purging, squashing my git log history
to remove my real identity when I discovered my push delivery method was mixing-up several
github accounts I am using for different purpose.
This is lesson is learnt with hours of troubleshooting and searching and I will certainly make another blog post to explain.
I advise against a shortcut where you test with real content without verification of your SecOps Delivery process.</p>
