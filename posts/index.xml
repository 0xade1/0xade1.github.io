<h3 id="social-media-dominant-ideology-is-corrupting-people-thoughts">Social Media dominant ideology is corrupting people thoughts</h3>
<p>In an increasingly manicheist world loosing its sense of shades and scales of Tolerance towards extremes sides,
I found difficult to publicly express my view of facts and events that may contradicts dominant ideology.
I was looking for a way to post my opinions and thoughts online while avoiding the new norm of social media pressure
that systematically judges you according to some political prism or psychological bias.</p>
<p>While social network is the right place to reach the mass, it is certainly not the forum were you can speak freely and openly
without consequences, and I felt my wording will be influenced by my readers and not honestly reflects what is on my mind.
Thinking a bit further I have realized that my readers may want to comment as well,
and I was wondering how I could offer them this feature with the same level of privacy I am advocating in this post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the limit of freedom of speech when you apply self-censorship to avoid hypothetical consequences that may or may never occure,
such as loosing your job, contracts or opportunities because some folks may not like what you have to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So well I have chosen to keep my ambition small with a limited reach and without associating my name in a too obvious manner
to whoever may want to use what I have posted online against me.
I bet that those who find value in what I post will share and promote its content
or follow some of the present guidelines in this article to safeguard their own privacy,
and I trust that those who know me will respect that and avoid to disclose my identity.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-constantly-tracked-and-profiled">We are constantly tracked and profiled</h3>
<p><strong>Anonymity vs Pseudonymity vs Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Purpose in here has never been and will never be anonymity: any motivated actors or government can easily track back to my personal identity.
Pseudonymity is more appropriate to describe in which way I can reach a much better level of privacy that prevents:</p>
<ul>
<li>mass surveillance of citizen&rsquo;s opinion from governments</li>
<li>tracking, profiling and targeted ads from big techs</li>
<li>internal pressure or retorsion ignited be your company executives</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A blog that tracks my audience hurts my life principles</strong></p>
<p>I could have chosen the lazy way with a blog hosted in <strong>medium</strong> or <strong>blogpost</strong> or equivalent.
However the entire purpose of this is to raise awareness and protect my audience privacy from various tracking and fingerprinting techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>capture your cookies or navigation history</li>
<li>capture your movement from, to or within the website</li>
<li>capture your eyes: which portion of a page are you looking the most</li>
<li>map your visit activity with an external account (google)</li>
<li>harvest your details for commercial gain</li>
<li>track your identity for marketing campaigns through various techniques:
<ul>
<li>browser fingerprinting</li>
<li>device fingerprinting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deliver a personalized customer journey <strong>bullshit</strong> across devices, channels and platforms with Adbrain customer ID mapping technology</li>
<li>Behavioral fingerprinting with Machine Learning behavior pattern analysis</li>
<li>bother your audience with advertisement within your site, even when they don&rsquo;t comment</li>
<li>slow down navigation and traffic, and may even lag when showing my pages</li>
<li>use domain obfuscation and various techniques to try to evade ads blocker</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side note, 99% of the internet is embedding tracker such as google-analytics, twitter or facebook like buttons and much more,
and github may have some analytics on server logs regarding github-pages,
so I can only advocate that you use at least a VPN or some kind of browser extensions such as <strong>ublock origin</strong> or <strong>privacy badger</strong>.
But this is another blog post topic.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-built-this-privacy-friendly-blog">How I built this privacy friendly blog</h2>
<h3 id="a-private-email-address-to-register-github-pages">a private email address to register github pages</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have first created an anonymous email address for the solely purpose to register a github account without sharing my personal details or email.
Any privacy-friendly email provider such as protonvpn or tutanota will be fine, as long as they don&rsquo;t track you. I won&rsquo;t use this email or email alias for any other purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a first approach and before investing in domain name and hosting, we can host our website for free on <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a></strong>.
The website will be accessible with <code>username.github.io</code>, so it is better not to use an overly complicated or long username, short is better.
Should I mention that putting your real name as username, defeats the purpose of this article?</p>

<h3 id="a-statically-generated-website-not-to-be-hacked">A statically generated website not to be hacked</h3>
<p>What is common with all <strong>CMS (Content management system)</strong> I know such as <code>wordpress</code>, <code>drupal</code>, <code>joomla</code> &hellip;
is how frequently hackers exploits zero-days or disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise those websites.
Whether the backend is PHP, ASP.Net, Java, Nodejs, &hellip; does not matter as much as the perspective for a hacker to takeover
the website backend to remotely execute code. Another major issues are backend and software updates (operating system, CMS &hellip;)
which may not be performed timely, or may break the website between major upgrades.
I personnally don&rsquo;t want to spend time patching things of fixing things after patching.</p>
<p>To avoid the above issues, I made the decision to go for a statically generated website with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
As there is no server-side code, it is closed to impossible to takeover the backend and
a more probable attack vector is to compromise instead the github credentials, tokens or ssh keys &hellip;
which are not accessible from the website itself, but from my laptop which therefore becomes the most likely attack vector.
While, most of the security of the blog is managed by github directly, there is a set of good practices that I generally recommend,
to avoid being the weakest link:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a password manager to vault your email and github credentials, with strong password encryption</li>
<li>secure your ssh keys with a passphrase</li>
<li>use a different ssh keys per repositories</li>
<li>github token should have the minimum permissions as possible</li>
<li>never reuse an existing github token for a different purpose, create a new token instead</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-deployment-strategy-to-mitigate-your-real-identity-leak">A deployment strategy to mitigate your real identity leak</h3>
<p>Manual is always error-prone and may result in leaking my identity by mistake.
I have therefore decided to automate the build and deployment of the hugo static website into GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
Creating a Hugo website and setting up a GitHub pages is out of scope for this article.</p>
<p>There is mostly two strategies to deal with deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>use a single repository</strong> with two branches: main branch for source code and gh-pages for published website</li>
<li><strong>use separate repositories</strong>: the source code is in a private repository and receive manual commits, github-actions auto-commit static pages into the gh-pages repo</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>single repository</th>
<th>Separate repositories</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>🟢 single repository = &gt; less maintenance</td>
<td>🔴 Additional work to set up and configure two repos (one-time-effort)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 different contents between your source branch and the gh-pages branch</td>
<td>💚 Align with clean git branching strategies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 commit leaks and comments are publicly available, beware of <code>git config</code></td>
<td>💚 manual commit on a private repo, github-actions to push without leak to your gh-pages repo</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The separate repositories approach works better on a pure SecOps perspective,
but it is not sufficient as it could be possible to inadvertently leak information on the articles content itself.
Therefore I have to consider the review process prior github-actions automatically build and deploy content to gh-pages.</p>
<p>When considering the review process, we must consider as well that we can build and re-deploy :</p>
<ul>
<li>at every single commit</li>
<li>when reviewing an issue in github</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>every single commit</th>
<th>after a PR is approved</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>🔴 There is no possible review process</td>
<td>💚 you can enforce review and squash commits prior merge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 once commited, content is publicly exposed</td>
<td>💚 once committed you have to approve before merge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 all commits metadata are publicly available</td>
<td>💚 source repo commits are private, gh-pages commits have no sensitive information</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔴 energy consuming</td>
<td>💚 Energy friendly as we build only when we have meaningful changes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We will build and deploy after a PR (a github issue) is approved</p>
<h3 id="a-comment-engine-which-is-respectful-of-your-privacy">A comment engine which is respectful of your privacy</h3>
<p>When it comes with blogging, we want to interact with people and receive feedback. This interaction is priceless to confront ideas and build better ones.
While there is plethor of engines to offer incredibly friendly comment features on a static blog, I found the privacy price-tag incredibly high,
and most of those solutions were quite expensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again whether cheap or expensive, money trail implies easy back-tracking to people real identity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a backend, I need to use javascript tokens and a third-party engine such as infamous <code>disqus</code>, and I can&rsquo;t keep to question
the security of such tokens: it could be used by someone malicious to flood me with thousands of fake comments.
Another option could be <code>facebook comments</code> which requires user to be tracked by facebook instead of disqus.</p>
<p>Such third-parties tracking my audience and my website traffic totally goes against my principles, whichever the reason (targeted ads&hellip;).
I found instead that anybody can create an anonymous or pseudonymized github account like the gh-pages account running this website,
and this will allow them to comment or contribute to my privacy project without a need to disclose their real identity nor register an external services.</p>
<p>This website is using <code>github issues</code> as a backend and offers all commenting features available in github 😍 !!!
It is totally free and does not require a third party or a token:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each visitor can read all comments anonymously (no login required)</li>
<li>Each visitor is offered the possibility to leave a comment with their github account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>quick comparison analysis</strong>:</p>
<p>The main reason for using github for comments is because github issues have not be designed with profiling or tracking in mind
as opposed to social media. It is using API and is free from those fancy but common features aiming to track people:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TEST YOUR GITHUB ACTION with DUMMY content</strong></li>
<li><strong>VERIFY your github commits meta data are free from leaks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I had to go on a long process of tries, fails and learn: purging, squashing my git log history
to remove my real identity when I discovered my push delivery method was mixing-up several
github accounts I am using for different purpose.
This is lesson is learnt with hours of troubleshooting and searching and I will certainly make another blog post to explain.
I advise against a shortcut where you test with real content without verification of your SecOps Delivery process.</p>

<p>I first edit my theme <code>layouts/partials/comments.html</code> file so that the comments section
is only visible if the article has a <strong>ghcommentid</strong>. The ghcommentid is simply a github issue id,
that I have especially created to deliver and receive comments.</p>

<li>There is two Matched Request, first bet is: first match is Host header resolution or some validation on the host and second is admin clicking.</li>
<li>Once the email sent, I need to rebind to my IP address instead of 127.0.0.1, otherwise the attacker machine won&rsquo;t receive the HTTP GET when the admin click the link. FakeDNS allows DNS rebinding after a certain amount of tries.
Apparently, two first Match requests are for validation only, otherwise is I have an error message otherwise. So I decide to rebind after 2 requests.</li>

</div><p>port 445 is open and detected OS is Microsoft XP which is not receiving security updates for many years and therefore likely vulnerable to Eternal Blue attack used by Wannacry ransomware.</p>
<p>Best approach would be to attempt some very common exploit on SMB protocol which are available on Metasploit framework.</p>
<p>We can further assess SMB vulnerability on port 445 with nmap</p>

<p>Downloading remote desktop <code>brew install microsoft-remote-desktop-beta</code> failed,
so we get it from the Apple Store &lsquo;Microsoft Remote Desktop 10&rsquo;.
Unfortunately I am not successful to connect with remote desktop connection.
Indeed port 5985 was not in our initial nmap, therefore it may be blocked by firewall.
We should be able to reverse forward this port on our local machine using <code>chisel</code></p>

</div><p>we find intelligence.php which gives us some hints on how to talk with the speech to text artificial intelligence.
We need a text-to-speech implementation which is the closest to Microsoft US-male implementation.
Trying with MacOsX <code>say</code>command is not successful and therefore we install festival on our docker machine.
Because our docker does not have a graphic interface (X installed is not installed), We build another script <a href="./ai.py">ai.py</a> to submit the WAV file generated with festival.</p>

</div><p>It is very useful to leverage Firefox Developer tools Network tab together with a custom python3 proxy
such as <a href="./http_proxy.py">http_proxy.py</a> or <a href="./tcp_proxy.py">tcp_proxy.py</a> to audit and analyze the http form POST.
We could also have used Blurp-suite but it was more fun to code a little bit, and what if we can&rsquo;t use burp during an engagement?</p>

<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon">Sysmon Event ID</a></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are looking for a file downloaded through Firefox, so best is to find
<code>Sysmon Event ID 2: A process changed a file creation time</code> from process &ldquo;firefox.exe&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can find this searching for sysmon file creation event id 2 with a process named firefox.exe and not junk .temp files.
We can use regular expressions to include or exclude patterns:</p>
<pre><code>FileCreateTime AND firefox NOT TargetFilename:/.+\.temp/
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: C:\Users\minty\Downloads\cookie_recipe.exe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can find which ip address the malicious file has connected with sysmon <code>EventID=3 (Network connection)</code> and by pivoting on ProcessImage name</p>
<pre><code>ProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.exe/ AND eventID=3
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 192.168.247.175:4444</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with <code>Event ID 1: Process creation</code>, we can <code>pivot off</code> on child processes as we know cookie_recipe.exe ProcessId=5256</p>
<p>Alternatively, since all commands by the attacker are initially running through the cookie_recipe.exe binary,
we can set its full-path as our ParentProcessImage to <code>find child processes</code> it creates sorting on timestamp.</p>
<pre><code>ParentProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.exe/ AND eventID=1
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>ParentProcessId:5256
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: whoami</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We keep scrolling down the result until we find a service
Continuing on using the cookie_reciper.exe binary as our ParentProcessImage,
we should see some more commands later on related to a service.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: webexservice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can see all commands passed by the attacker by passing the binary path used for privileges escalation to ParentProcessCommandLine.
Indeed, The attacker elevates privileges using the vulnerable webexservice to run a file called cookie_recipe2.exe.
Let&rsquo;s use this binary path in our ParentProcessImage search.</p>
<pre><code>ParentProcessImage:C\:\\Users\\minty\\Downloads\\cookie_recipe2.exe CommandLine:/.+.exe/
</code></pre>
<p>We find some interesting arguments passed to an executable: <code>sekurlsa::logonpasswords</code>.
Those arguments are usually passed to mimikatz to activate a module that extracts passwords,
keys, pin codes, tickets from the memory of <code>lsass (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: C:\cookie.exe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to see 5 minutes surrounding last <code>mimikatz</code> message for Logon event (EventId=4624).
According to <a href="https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4624">this resource</a>
4624 is a highly valuable event since it documents each and every successful attempt to logon to the local computer
regardless of logon type, location of the user or type of account.</p>
<p>How do we know it is not legitimate login? Because it comes from the Address of the attacker:</p>
<pre><code>EventID:4624 AND SourceNetworkAddress:192.168.247.175
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: alabaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can <code>identify RDP connection</code> with successful Logon Event (4624) having Type=10 (Remote Desktop)</p>
<pre><code>EventID:4624 AND LogonType:10
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 06:04:28 ** (HH:MM:SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LogonType=3 (File share access)</code>
The attacker has GUI access to workstation 2 via RDP.
They likely use this GUI connection to access the file system of of workstation 3 using explorer.exe
via UNC file paths (which is why we don&rsquo;t see any cmd.exe or powershell.exe process creates).
However, we still see the successful network authentication for this with event id 4624 and logon type 3.
We are looking for file sharing access which is logon type=3.
We can also exclude the original address of the attacker as we are informed that he pivots from the workstation 2 (the host he connected with RDP)</p>
<pre><code>EventID:4624 AND LogonType:3 AND NOT SourceNetworkAddress:192.168.247.175
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: elfu-res-wks2,elfu-res-wks3,3 (SourceHostName,DestinationHostname,LogonType)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We look first for <code>EventID:3 (Network Connection)</code> having as a source workstation 3 (elfu-res-wks3) and as a destination workstation 2 (elfu-res-wks2).
I have a bit struggled because I had to use wildcard for my graylog query to include results having domain name &lsquo;.localdomain&rsquo;</p>
<pre><code>DestinationHostname:/elfu-res-wks2.*/ AND SourceHostname:/elfu-res-wks3.*/
</code></pre>
<p>There is only two messages with EventID:3 after the initial RDP connection (see answer 7).</p>
<p>Common sense would be to pivot few seconds after this message and look for file creation on destination the host:</p>
<p><code>EventID 2 (a Process changed a file creation time)</code> or <code>EventID 11 (FileCreate)</code> should do the job</p>
<pre><code>source:&quot;elfu\-res\-wks2&quot; AND EventID:2 AND _exists_:TargetFilename
</code></pre>
<p>We can look for sysmon file creation event id of 2 with a source of workstation 2.
We can also use regex to filter out overly common file paths using something like:</p>
<pre><code>source:&quot;elfu\-res\-wks2&quot; AND EventID:2 AND _exists_:TargetFilename AND NOT TargetFilename:/.+ProgramData.+/
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: C:\Users\alabaster\Desktop\super_secret_elfu_research.pdf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Searching for <code>super_secret_elfu_research.pdf</code> after 06:05:03, we figure out the file was transfered to <code>pastebin.com</code>
Instead of trying all IP adresses from whois, we prefer look for connection from workstation 2 to domain &lsquo;pastebin.com&rsquo;</p>
<p>We can look for the original document in CommandLine using regex.
When we do that, we see a long a long PowerShell command using Invoke-Webrequest to a remote URL of <a href="https://pastebin.com/post.php">https://pastebin.com/post.php</a>.
We can pivot off of this information to look for a sysmon <code>EventID:3 (Network Connection)</code> with a source of elfu-res-wks2 and DestinationHostname of pastebin.com.</p>
<pre><code>EventID:3 AND source:&quot;elfu\-res\-wks2&quot; AND DestinationHostname:pastebin.com
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 104.22.3.84</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally we get the Flag</p>
<pre><code>Incident Response Report #7830984301576234 Submitted.

</ul>
<p>Looking at the url, we quickly figure out the Game in &lsquo;Easy&rsquo; mode communicates with the server with HTTP GET protocol without any server validation of inputs.</p>
<pre><code>hhc://trail.hhc/trail/?difficulty=0&amp;distance=670&amp;money=9964&amp;pace=0&amp;curmonth=12&amp;curday=20

</code></pre>
<p>We can simply change the distance in the url to 8000 and click &lsquo;Go&rsquo; &hellip; BAM, we won the party.</p>
<pre><code>Your party has succeeded!

    Lila is happier than an elf in a toy shop!
    Dop is ready to jingle bell rock!
    Jo is ecstatic!
    Chris is over the moon!
    Date completed: 2 July
    Reindeer remaining: 2
    Money remaining: 5000

Scoring:

    4 surviving party members X 1000 = 4000 points
    2 reindeer X 400 = 800 points
    5000 money left X 1 = 5000 points
    Journey completed on 2 July: 176 days before Christmas X 50 = 8800 points
    Total score: (4000 + 800 + 5000 + 8800) X 1 Easy multiplier = 18600!
    Verification hash: 2e668469748566b41e9dffbafc04f67b
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmm, this challenge seems way too easy &hellip; Wait a minute, Minty is not giving us any hint and is still asking help to solve the challenge!
It may be because I&rsquo;ve used the direct url to the trail game instead of the browser &hellip;
somehow I might have to do it from within Kringlecon instead of spending more effort.</p>
<p>So I choose the lazy way and use Burp instead: this time parameter are passed in HTTP POST but it does not really make any difference with BURP :).
Challenge is won, Minty is giving hints on making Key from a picture.</p>
<p>The HARD challenge is much harder because this time the server control a hash value and will detect when we tamper with the distance parameter.</p>

<p>His inner voice may comes from an attacker compromising his IOT teeth braces.
He could exfiltrate information such as some prototype being hosted with default credentials in srf.elfu.org; it&rsquo;s not related to this challenge.

</div>
</div><p>Below are the instructions to win this challenge:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the default policies to DROP for the INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains.</li>
<li>Create a rule to ACCEPT all connections that are ESTABLISHED,RELATED on the INPUT and the OUTPUT chains.</li>
<li>Create a rule to ACCEPT only remote source IP address 172.19.0.225 to access the local SSH server (on port 22).</li>
<li>Create a rule to ACCEPT any source IP to the local TCP services on ports 21 and 80.</li>
<li>Create a rule to ACCEPT all OUTPUT traffic with a destination TCP port of 80.</li>
<li>Create a rule applied to the INPUT chain to ACCEPT all traffic from the lo interface</li>
</ol>
<p>My solution is the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 172.19.0.225 -j ACCEPT

<h2 id="crate">CRATE</h2>
<p>There is a hidden div object in the Student Union with class=&lsquo;crate&rsquo;. indeed his css style attribute <code>display: none</code>.</p>
<p>Changing it to the value <code>display: block</code> and changing the z-layer to a higher value did not help either as it is below the floor div objects.
The hint says we can move elements? maybe we can pull the lid off.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Firefox Developer tools console, and the code will be right there: ** B3PLY0XQ ** (the code will change when page is reloaded)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one got me busy for some time, until I figure out there were more hints; simply Print preview the page as a PDF within Firefox and the code will be obviously stamped: J092WFRA (the code chage when we reload the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at DEvTools Network view, we observe an image has been downloaded many times. Looking at it, we get the flag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We look at devTools storage. Amazing, the barrels object containing the code is in a form of a key-value pair in the &lsquo;Local Storage&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol, I tried to copy the code in the html:title tags from source but it did not work. Typing in the console <code>document.title</code> reveals the title has been changed with a new code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hint is &lsquo;perspective&rsquo; is css property, so let&rsquo;s try the devTools Inspector. Changing the perspective value to &lsquo;px&rsquo; or increasing the transition period reveals the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hint instructed us to look at the first entry of the css font-family. Indeed the flag is there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I google &lsquo;Firefox view event handlers&rsquo;. We read carefully and indeed, the inspector is showing an &lsquo;event&rsquo; tag. We click on the event tag and the javascript shows us that VERONICA is sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We lookup for chakra on the source code within the inspector, and as per instructed by the hint, a right-click on the span elements having class=chakras followed with changing the pseudo-class to active =&gt; one or couple letter revealed. We just iterate on all span elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we right click the last lock to see the DOM element. This lock has a cover with a disabled button. with the DOM inspector, we can select this div and delete it.
We find the code printed in the</p>

</code></pre><p>We successfully got the name of the Villain who is the &lsquo;Tooth Fairy&rsquo;. It was not necessary to open the crate neither to show the hidden crate box in the student union. However Shiny upatree keeps telling &lsquo;Hey there&rsquo; &hellip; maybe the challenge was not intended to be completed that way? Nevermind, we spent way too much time to figure out how to open the crate, so we will keep it for later.</p>

<p>click on the date/timestamp from that first event, and specify a time window.

<p>hex PIDs are 0x2248=8776 child_of 0x16e8=5864 child of 0xc10=3088, New_Process_ID is in hex while sysmon process_id is in decimal, so we have to convert those hex value into a decimal</p>

<p>there is a powershell payload encoded in base64 =&gt; <code>payload.decode('base64').replace('\x00','').lower()</code></p>

<p>All the above PIDs did not help, instead setting the time filter to show all events before the powershell script call,
then look for <code>EventCode=4688</code> and used <code>| reverse</code> to order by time desc.

</ul>
<p>Near the grinder machine we find Krampus who is wearing the key. Looking at the <code>DevTools Network</code> tab,
we can capture the png file that contains the key picture.
Then we use gimp together with guides downloaded from Deviant&rsquo;s github.
Using <code>gimp</code> we decode the following bitting: 12252</p>
<p>I was not accessible to use the machine to produce the key,
but could figure out from source code the url based should looks like <a href="https://key.elfu.org/backend/keys/SC4_preview/12252?.png">https://key.elfu.org/backend/keys/SC4_preview/12252?.png</a></p>
<p>The server always complaining of an invalid bitting length,
I have therefore generated two keys with a zero at the beginning or at end of the code
to retrieve the key from the server with the following url <code>https://key.elfu.org/backend/keys/SC4_preview/122520.png</code></p>
<p>We now have access to the Steam tunnels and we can speak with Krampus who reveal his name and admit having &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; the two turtle doves.</p>

<h2 id="frido-sleigh-contest-objective-8">Frido Sleigh contest (Objective 8)</h2>
<p>This is about machine learning image recognition with Tensorflow</p>
<p>This challenge is open to elves, not to human &hellip;
so naturally, we have to submit a CAPTEHA which is a CAPTCHA-equivalent technology to prove we are &lsquo;not&rsquo; a human</p>
<p><strong>Loool! I love the creativity of those challenges makers.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed the challenge cannot be done manually by a human on the website
because the CAPTEHA is only visible 5 seconds with too many images to classify.
So the solution is to use instead the API and build an image recognition classifier model
using tensorflow to mimic the speed and efficacy of elves.</p>

so to get the full payload we will probably need something like Burp-suite or custom python code.
Never-mind, challenge developers had the kindness to develop for us the capteha-api.py
which contains the code we are interesting to analyze the capteha requests.
I am actually running this code to observe the response payload in detail.

</div><p>No luck, my docker machine is not very powerful and it takes 35 seconds to execute and predict very accurately all images.</p>
<p>I need to find a way to do it more effectively and below the 5 seconds time out!
maybe the image bank is limited and we can exhaust the bank by keeping a hash of all uuid we have previously figure-out the class?</p>
<p>Actually, only the first part of the uuid needs to be used as a key for our dictionary.</p>
<p>Well, after dozen runs and about 10k images hash generated,
My cache (a simple python dictionary) has never been hit :( !!!</p>
<p>Either the image bank is huge or there is a slight and unexpensive random transformation
to prevent me to build a rainbow table of K-V pairs (K=hash of the base64 image, V=image class guessed by Tensorflow).</p>
<p>So I try to move on another technique that consists to use the GPU instead of the CPU.
However again, I am not lucky, my laptop is using an <code>Intel HD graphics</code>
which is in my understanding a virtual GPU embedded in the CPU &hellip; with terrible performance &hellip;</p>
<p>so lessons learnt is you have to be a gamer when you want to do ML.</p>
<p>Actually this statement is not true, someone in the forum suggested to move on <code>Google Colab</code> which allows to use TensorFlow with GPU for free!
It is a completely new journey I want to try.</p>
<p>My source code needed few adjustements and I built the following two python notebook :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./retrain.ipynb">retrain.ipynb</a></li>
<li><a href="./predict.ipynb">predict.ipynb</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Google Tensorflow with GPU enabled are abolutely fantastic as it could classify all 100 images in a blink.
Then the challenge answer is received on my email address.</p>

Instead of using SQLMAP tool that automates the job, I want to try to break it manually.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s try to get the application status with a SQLI and without getting an error message with: <code>'a@a.com';</code>.
The web page has some javascript that check the format of my email address and prompt us <code>Please enter a valid email address</code>.</p>
<p>We can use burp-suite to by-pass this control, but developer tools should be enough.
I find the javascript function <code>submitApplication()</code> which itself calls the function <code>elfsign()</code>
which sends an XmlHttpRequest with /validator.php &hellip;</p>
<p>it sounds like it provides a token that will be checked on server side.
This make our task a bit more complicated.</p>

<li>DES cryptanalysis</li>
</ul>
<p>First we generate a bunch of file containing &lsquo;A&rsquo; a certain number of times.
As an example A7.txt contains 7*&lsquo;A&rsquo;, when A32.txt contains 32*&lsquo;A&rsquo; &hellip;
it allows us to figure out that the encryption algorithm is DES with 8 bytes keys.</p>
<p>Kudos to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obJdpKDpFBA">Ron Bowes</a> for this excellent introduction tutorial on crypto reverse engineering.</p>
<p>We could alternatively have figure out the algorithm from IDA with this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/alg-id">reference</a>
which explains the ALG_ID=6601 passed to <code>mov [ebp+keyBlob.hdr.aiKeyAlg], 6601h</code> is for DES algorithm.</p>
<p>Looking at elfscrow.exe binary in IDA-free,
We find some functions of interest, including super_secure_random(..) function
where we see the below two hexadecimal values:</p>

It means that we can generate the exact same seed or bruteforce it if we know a narrow interval time.</p>
<p>We got the following hints for this objective: <strong>We know that it was encrypted on December 6, 2019, between 7pm and 9pm UTC.</strong>
which is only 2hours<em>60</em>60=7,200 seconds.</p>
<p>Bruteforcing the file will take at most 7,200 tries.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;super secure srand&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do much, it simply prints out the seed
and put it in the &lsquo;state&rsquo; variable which is used later by super_secure_random function
which is equivalent to the python msvcrt_rand(seed) above</p>

We find some MD5-CRYPT <code>$1$RxS1ROtX$IzA1S3fcCfyVfA9rwKBMi.</code> hash that we can break with john: it&rsquo;s the empty string
Another MD5 hash <code>5e0bd03bec244039678f2b955a2595aa</code> can be cracked to <code>nessus</code></p>
<p>Concatenation of hexadecimals h = &lsquo;0x617664737363616e6e696e67L&rsquo; which translates via python h[2:-1].decode(&lsquo;hex&rsquo;) into &lsquo;avdsscanning&rsquo;

sudo apt install python3-pip

#### Running:

python3 ./srfweb.py

#### Logging in:

You can login using the default admin pass:

admin 924158F9522B3744F5FCD4D10FAC4356

However, it's recommended to change this in the sqlite db to something custom.

<p>The password local variable is immediately followed by the name local in the stack. We can fill the name local with a bunch of &lsquo;A&rsquo;</p>
<pre><code>Higher address
+---------------------------+
|000000000000000000000000000|   password[64]
+---------------------------+
|0000000............AAAAAAAA|   name[256]
+---------------------------+
Lower addres
</code></pre>
<p>Later in the code, a 28 bytes string is appended to the name variable, and therefore it will overflow the password variable if we have written at least 256-27 * &lsquo;A&rsquo; in name</p>
<blockquote>
<p>strcat(name, &ldquo;,\nPlease Enter the Password.&quot;);</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>+---------------------------+

+---------------------------+
|t retnE esaelP\n,AAA...AAAA|   name
+---------------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>The consequence is there is no longer <code>\x00</code> character in the name variable to mark the end of string, and therefore a latter puts(name) will leak the content of both variables.</p>
<p>Indeed the password is then populated resulting in the below stack:</p>
<pre><code>+---------------------------+
|00000000&lt;--real password--&gt;|   password
+---------------------------+
|t retnE esaelP\n,AAA...AAAA|   name
+---------------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>A latter greeting message calls <code>puts(name)</code> which results in the below output that reveals the password to get the flag: &lsquo;AAAA&hellip;.AAA\nPlease Enter t&lt;&ndash;real password&ndash;&gt;&rsquo;</p>

<h3 id="establish-the-libc_base-address-and-system-function-offset">Establish the libc_base address and system function offset</h3>
<p>We establish the libc base address (prior ASLR offset) with this simple equation:
** libc_base = runtime_address_of_func - symbol_address_of_func **</p>

<p>We already have the runtime address of the <code>write</code> function from the program output (0xf7e5e6f0), we can use libc-database to get the symbol address:</p>

</div><p>It is possible to use a format-string to write any address at an arbitrary location.
A great resources to demonstrate is <a href="http://codearcana.com/posts/2013/05/02/introduction-to-format-string-exploits.html">codearcana</a></p>
<p>Our exploitation path is the below:</p>
<ol>
<li>To achieve this, we find the address of the authenticated global (0x804a04c) with objdump or <code>pwn.symbols['authenticated']</code></li>
<li>We craft a format-string payload that contains the address 0x804a04c with a large sequence of &lsquo;%p&rsquo;</li>
<li>We pass this format-string as an argument to the vulnerable printf function, therefore our format string is in the stack frame of printf</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The format-string is in the stackframe of printf and looks like: <code>payload = pwn.p32(elf.symbols['authenticated']) + '%p'*50</code></li>
<li>%p is an external representation of a pointer to void (in other words, it&rsquo;s a 32bits address)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Executed, the format-string will dump the stackframe content &hellip;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Therefore we should find the relative position on the stackframe of the address 0x804a04c</li>
<li>We find the address is at position 11</li>
<li>Another representation to simplify the payload is: <code>payload = pwn.p32(elf.symbols['authenticated']) + '%11$p'</code></li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>We can now leverage another format-string to write a number at 0x804a04c (the address of the &lsquo;authenticated&rsquo; global)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Instead of %11$p  (print the 11th dword on the stack), we can use %n11$p</li>
<li>%11$n writes the number of printed characters at the address pointed 11 dwords further in the stack</li>
<li><code>payload = pwn.p32(elf.symbols['authenticated']) + '%11$n'</code> : indeed, &lsquo;n&rsquo; will write the number of char written by printf which is 4 because of pwn.p32(&hellip;) size.</li>
</ul>

<li>After the format string exploitation, instead of executing <code>puts(&quot;\n&quot;)</code>, vuln() will be recursively called and the user will be prompted again to input a message.</li>
<li>Except, that this time, the user input would be passed to the system function instead of printf.</li>
<li>The user can simply manually pass any command as input, such as <code>ls</code> or <code>cat flag.txt</code> or <code>/bin/sh</code> to obtain a shell</li>

<p>Note that this attack may not be possible as-is on a modern heap implementation. Success to run the exploit depends on which heap implementation the target operating system is using.
Therefore, exploit code adjustments along with thorough understanding of the heap implementation are needed to have this technique works.</p>

<p>The abbreviation NX stands for non-execute or non-executable segment. It means that the application, when loaded in memory, does not allow any of its segments to be both writable and executable. The idea here is that writable memory should never be executed (as it can be manipulated) and vice versa.</p>

As opposed to crypto warmup 1, we don&rsquo;t have the key so we have to bruteforce it.
We will use cryptanalysis python code from rosetta.org to find the key:

<p>We download a png file that we are not able to open with the command <code>eog</code>. There is obviously soething wrong about this file that requires us to investigate with forensics tool. We first do some reconnaissance on the file itself with the command <code>file</code> which informs us that the fyle type is not a png but a jepg file. Simply changing the extension to jpg solves our problem.</p>

<p>The user connect with netcat <code>nc</code> on a remote shell and is then prompted to answer a set of multiple questions with a time constraint. Once the user has answered all the questions correctly, he obtains the flag; however upon wrong answer or timeout, he is being kicked-out of the shell and has to re-iterate the process.</p>
<p>All 4 questions are based on the exploration of a json file <code>cat incidents.json</code>
My first approach was to script all the answer, but then I realise that questions are sometime changing, and therefore make it a bit more tricky to copy-paste valid answer.</p>
<p>While I could have scripted using regex extraction, I chose instead a second approach that leverages the command <code>jq</code> followed by copy-paste:</p>

<p>We assume this is a steganography challenge, so we first try to solve this challenge by simply leveraging <code>zsteg</code> command. This command tries basic and common steganography algorithm for us:</p>

<p>we download a block device dump file <code>animals.dd</code>. We create a folder to mount the file</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir mnt; mount animals.dd mnt; ls mnt
</code></pre><p>It contains several images but none of them contains an obvious flag.</p>
<p>Before we investigate each image independently, we want to look whether some images have been deleted from the block device
because we know that following the <code>rm</code> command, files are still recoverable unless the disk allocated space has been over-written.
We use <code>foremost animals.dd</code>, and indeed a folder <code>output/jpg/</code> is created and contains deleted images we could recover.
One of the recovered image contains the flag.</p>

<p>We have a download link called &ldquo;Meta material&rdquo; pointing to an image 2018.png which apparently contains a flag. However this is just diversion. The image url name &ldquo;meta-material&rdquo;, makes us suspect we have to look for meta-information embedded in the file instead of the file data itself.</p>
<p>We will use <code>exiftool</code> or <code>zsteg</code> to extract meta-information</p>

<p>The hint is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Is it really all one shade of red?

Another approach is to create a plain monochramatic red image and then substract it from the original image to get the difference.
The result should contain only pixels with a different color shade then the plain monochromatic image.</p>

</div><p>Hints are provided <a href="https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html">here</a>: if you are using a Linux/Mac OS X/Unix system, you can use the <code>file</code> command to determine the file type based upon the file signature, per the system&rsquo;s <code>magic</code> file.</p>
<p>Googling &ldquo;ext2 magic number&rdquo;, we found this <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/239088/whats-a-file-systems-magic-number-in-a-super-block">resource</a>:
For example, an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem always has the bytes <code>0x53 0xEF</code> at positions <strong>1080–1081</strong>.</p>
<p>So theoretically we just have to patch bytes 1080-1081 with value 0x53EF to have our file being recognized as Ext filesystem</p>
<p>We can use xxd to swiftly patch manually the file:</p>

<p>Opening the file with wireshark, we can then use the <code>dnsserver</code> filter to get rid of all other protocols. Remain two DNS messages; one of them contains the flag in cleartext</p>
<p>we could have just used the <code>strings</code> command but it is interesting</p>

</div><p>We can alternatively calculate ourselves the fibonacci number if we respect two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>keep only first 32bits to simulate the dword overflow</li>
<li>avoid recursion to avoid <code>RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can simulate the overflow by using <code>numpy.uint32(..)</code> or <code>number &amp; 0xFFFFFFFF</code></li>
<li>To avoid recursion, we can use a Memoization decorator that will cache in a dictionary any previous fibonacci&rsquo;s number it calculated in the past</li>

<li>Option 1: We patch the binary with radare2 so that calculate_key function returns directly the key 0x221d8eea</li>

<h3 id="option-1-patch-with-radare2">Option 1: Patch with radare2</h3>
<p>we open in RW mode with radare2 a copy of the binary called be-quick-or-be-dead-3-patched, then we patch it with the instructions <code>mov eax, &lt;RETURN_VALUE&gt;; ret</code></p>

<p>Also, the rotation is on AL which is 1 byte size; therefore the rotation is on 8 bits</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/mov">movzx</a> instruction at address 0x080485f2 loads unsigned 8-bit value into 32-bit register eax and zero-extend</p>
<p>Hence, we can translate into python:</p>
