The encoding works two bytes at a time because of range(.., 2). So we have to read 16bits at a time. Every two bytes, each byte are converted in integer value with ord First byte is multiplied by 256 with &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8 operation, then second byte is added to the result &amp;#39;&amp;#39;.</description></item><item><title>picoCTF 2018 - Reverse Engineering</title><link>https://0xade1.github.io/posts/2019/12/picoctf-2018-reverse-engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:54:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://0xade1.github.io/posts/2019/12/picoctf-2018-reverse-engineering/</guid><description>Recommended resources: Assembler tutorial Register Calling conventions common-x86-calling-conventions X86_Disassembly/Calling_Conventions Wikipedia x86_64 calling convention assembly-0 The program is called with two arguments: asm0(0xc9, 0xb0), so the stack frame looks like the following: calling convention is cdecl | adress of argument2 | ebp+12 | adress of argument1 | ebp+8 | return address | ebp+4 | old ebp | &amp;lt;--- ebp nasm code source:
.intel_syntax noprefix .bits 32 .global asm0 asm0: push ebp ;prolog mov ebp,esp ;prolog mov eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] ;eax receives 4 bytes pointing to argument1 which is the value 0xc9 mov ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc] ;ebx receives 4 bytes pointing to argument2 which is the value 0xb0 mov eax,ebx ;eax is overwritten by ebx mov esp,ebp ;epilog pop ebp ;epilog ret ;epilog mov eax, DWORD PTR [mem]: Get 32-bit value at memory address and store it in eax register: see here</description></item></channel></rss>
